5. If the user has already rated the course:
   - Execute UPDATE query to update the rating:
     - Query: "UPDATE ratings SET rating = :rating WHERE course_id = :course_id AND student_id = :student_id"
   - Return success: {"success": true, "message": "Rating updated successfully"}

6. If the user has not rated the course:
   - Execute INSERT query to add a new rating:
     - Query: "INSERT INTO ratings (course_id, student_id, rating) VALUES (:course_id, :student_id, :rating)"
   - Return success: {"success": true, "message": "Rating submitted successfully"}

7. If any error occurs during the process, return error: {"success": false, "message": "Error submitting rating: [error message]"}
